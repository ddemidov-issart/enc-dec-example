### What is it?

Example of encryption and decryption for files

1. To start from scratch, you have to generate key-pair (or use mine). See [key-pair-gen/readme.md](key-pair-gen/readme.md)
2. Then try to encrypt something. See [enc-app/readme.md](enc-app/readme.md).
3. And finally, try to decrypt previously encrypted file. See [dec-app/readme.md](dec-app/readme.md).

BTW: Each example contains everything what it's needed to run. 
So, you may start from decryption (it already contains encrypted data example).
